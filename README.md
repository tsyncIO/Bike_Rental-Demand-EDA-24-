# Bike_Rental-Demand-EDA-24-
End-to-End ML project to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C

Bike Sharing EDA Project
Overview
This project explores the Bike Sharing Demand dataset from Kaggle. The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key trends, relationships, and insights in the dataset that influence bike demand.

Dataset
The dataset contains hourly bike rental data for Washington, D.C., with features such as weather, season, and holidays.
Dataset files:

train.csv: Contains the training data with features and target variables.
test.csv: Contains the test data with features (without target variables).
sampleSubmission.csv: A sample submission file for predictions.
You can download the dataset from Kaggle's Bike Sharing Demand Competition.

Goals of the Analysis
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and distributions.
Identify key trends and patterns in bike sharing demand.
Examine relationships between variables (e.g., weather, season, time of day).
Visualize important insights using plots.
Steps Performed
Data Cleaning:

Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
Verified and corrected data types for columns.
Data Exploration:

Summary statistics for numerical and categorical variables.
Examined correlations between features and the target variable (count).
Visualization:

Distribution of bike demand over time (daily, monthly, seasonal trends).
Relationship between weather conditions and bike demand.
Impact of holidays, weekends, and working days on demand.
Feature Engineering (Optional):

Created new features like hour, day_of_week, and seasonal_adjustments.

Key Insights
Seasonal Trends:
Bike demand peaks during the summer months and decreases in winter.
Time of Day:
High demand during morning and evening rush hours (commute patterns).
Weather Impact:
Demand decreases with higher humidity and extreme weather conditions.
Weekends vs. Weekdays:
Higher casual usage on weekends; registered users dominate weekdays.
